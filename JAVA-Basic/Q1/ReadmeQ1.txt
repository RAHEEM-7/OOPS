	In this Problem we implemented a personal class.
	From that we derived two ABSTRACT classes Student and Employee.
	Abstract class is denoted by using "abstract" keyword and a 
	"abstract data member" in it denoted by  "abstract" keyword.
	
	Now from Student class we derived two clasess 
		Sponsored and Nonsponsored.
	In those classes we used  two functions calculatefee() to calculate Fee,
	and dispay() to display the contents.
	In main we instances to these two clasess ie Sponsored and Nonsponsored and
	calculate Fee and then print the details.
	
	And from Employee class we derived two clasess
		Faculty and Staff.
	In those clasess we used three functions calculateIncrement() used to 
	calculate the increment in salary, calculatePromotedlevel() used to claculate
	the level and display() used to display the details.
	
	And Finally in main we created instance of Four clasess ie.
	> Sponsored
	> Nonsponsored
	> Faculty
	> Staff

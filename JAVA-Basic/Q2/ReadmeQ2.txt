	In this Problem we implemented Account class and from that 
	we derived CIBIL class.
	In that CIBIL class we calculated Credit history,Credit Utilization,Credit applications.
	And finally we calculate CIBIL score by using function calculateCIBIL().
	Also return true or false based on CIBIL score by using function isEligible().

	And finally in Main class we created instances of CIBIL class
	and calcutae CIBIL scores.
